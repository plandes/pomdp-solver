POMDP solve version 4.0 written by A. R. Cassandra

This file describes the file format for a policy graph file used in
the 'pomdp-solve' program.

Each line of the file represents one node of the policy graph and its
contents are:

  N  A    Z1 Z2 Z3 ...

Here 'N' is a node ID giving the node a unique name.  The 'A' is the
action number defined for this node; it is an integer refering to the
the POMDP file actions.  These are followed by a list of node IDs, one
for each observation.  Thus the list will have a length equal to the
number of observations in the POMDP.  This list specifies the
transitions in the policy graph.  The n'th number in the list will be
the index of the node that follows this one when the observation
received is 'n'.
