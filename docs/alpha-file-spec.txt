POMDP solve version 4.0 written by A. R. Cassandra

This file describes the file format for a set of alpha vectors used in
the 'pomdp-solve' program.

A set of vectors is the representation use for the value function and
each vector has an action associated with it.  The format specified
here is what is output from the 'pomdp-solve' program and what will be
necessary for input to the 'pomdp-solve' program with the '-policy'
command line option.

The format is simply:

<action>
<list of vector components>

<action>
<list of vector components>

etc...

Note that the length of the lists needs to be equal to the number of
states in the POMDP.  The parser for this type of file is very brittle
and doesn't handle ill-formed files very well.
