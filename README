Program for performing value iteration on partially observable Markov
decision processes (POMDPs).

Contents:

README: This file.

COPYRIGHT: The legal stuff.  This version of the code was done
           independently, but is based upon previous work done at
           Brown University.

PORT-instructions: This file has the information about porting and
                   compiling the code.  Probably the file you want to
                   look at next.

./docs: This directory has some useful documentation such as file
        formats, command line arguments, etc.  Look at this directory
        after you successfully get the code to compile.

./mdp: This directory contains the code for a library of low-level
       POMDP manipulation routines, including parsing files and the
       internal representation used by the program.  Only look at the
       stuff in this directory if you want to muck around with the
       file format and/or the internal representation.

./lp_solve: This directory contains the code for a public domain
            linear programming solver. It is included it in this
            distribution because some minor changes were needed to
            integrate it with the pomdp-solve code.  If the commerical
            program CPLEX does not exist, this is what is used to
            solve the linear programs required.

./solutions: This directory contains a repository of solutions that
             were generated from a stable earlier version for the
             program.  They can be used for reference or testing
             purposes and are the results of value iteration for some
             number of steps on some small problems.

./examples: This directory has some simple example POMDP files.  

./testing: This directory has some test cases used by the auto-test
           executable.
